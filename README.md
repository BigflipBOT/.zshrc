# my .zshrc file!
This repo contains my .zshrc file that I use every day. Maybe you will like it when you try it out ;) 
<img alt="Welcome to VHS" src="https://github.com/BigflipBOT/.zshrc/blob/master/demo.gif" width="800"/>  
above gif was created with [vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) btw.

## Setup
Of course first things first, ensure you have `zsh` installed and set as your shell.  
Then ou need to install `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting` and `starship`.  
If you are using arch btw you can install those dependencies with following command:  
```sh
sudo pacman -S zsh zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting starship
```
Then you should probably run `zkbd` to setup your special keys:
```sh
zkbd
```

There is no starship config in this repo. If you would like to get the same config that is present in the demo you can get it from [here](https://github.com/BigflipBOT/swayfx-cyberpunk-dotfiles/blob/master/starship.toml). In addition to get it working you should also install nerd font icons.
